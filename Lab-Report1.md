# Lab Report 1

## cd command
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ 
```
The orginal directory was inside of lecture1, but after excuting cd without an arguement it went back to just the user file directory.
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$
```
The orginal directory was just the user, but after excuting cd with the argument "lecture1" it added /lecture1 to the end of the directory path.
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd Hello.java
bash: cd: Hello.java: Not a directory
```
