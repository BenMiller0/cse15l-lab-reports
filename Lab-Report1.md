# Lab Report 1

## cd command
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ 
```
Executing cd with no arguement caused the orginal directory was inside of lecture1, but after excuting cd without an arguement it went back to just the user file directory.
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$
```
After excuting cd with the lecture1 directory as the arguement, it added /lecture1 to the end of the directory path.
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd Hello.java
bash: cd: Hello.java: Not a directory
```
Running cd with a file as the arguement caused what appears to be an error message to be displayed telling the user that the given file is not an arguement.

## ls command
